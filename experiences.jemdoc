- *Ordering-Free Robotic Platooning for Multi-Robot Navigation System* \n
1. Proposed a coordinated guiding vector field to guide robots to form an ordering-free platooning formation while moving along the desired paths. Potential applications of arbitrary-dimension desired paths including self-intersected, non-convex, closed and non-closed one. \n

- *Target Surrounding / Fencing for Multi-USV System* \n
1. Target Fencing in Rigid and Flexible Patterns: \n
Proposed a distributed unlabelled controller to attain rigid-formation or flexible-formation fencing in a unified framework. Analysis of a complicated nonlinear networked system with the inter-agent repulsive term.\n
2. Target Surrounding with Varying Topologies: \n
Proposed a distributed estimation-and-control hierarchical framework with jointly dwellingly connected topologies. Conducted lake experiments with three 1.6 meters-long HUSTER-16 USV vessels and a differential GPS station.\n
3. Target Fencing in Regular Polygon Formation: \n
Proposed a distributed unlabelled controller for second-order networked system to fence a moving target of unknown velocity within the convex hull and guarantee collision avoidance. Analysis of a nonlinear closed-loop system especially subject to the velocity estimation error. \n
4. Bearing-only Motional Target Surrounding: \n
Proposed a distributed bearing-only controller for multiple unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to encircle and rotate evenly around a motional target. Conducted real experimental with three HUSTER-0.3 USVs and a target vessel.\n
5. Multiple-Target Surrounding and Collision Avoidance: \n 
Proposed an equal-distance surrounding framework to encircle multiple moving targets with guaranteed collision avoidance. Conducted experiments with four HUSTER-0.3 USVs and two target vessels. 

- *Navigation and Landing for UAV-USV System* \n
1. Proposed a visual navigation and landing control paradigm or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to land on a moving autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). Conducted landing experiments with our HUSTER-30 ASV and the M-100 UAV. \n

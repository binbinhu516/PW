== Research Project
- *NTU-Schaeffler Joint Project: Brake-by-wire System Design and Regenerative Braking Control for AMR* \n
1. Proposed safety-critical control algorithm and conducted experiments on the real AMRs, including path generating and tracking, collision avoidance in the warehouse. \n


- *Ordering-Free Robotic Platooning for Multi-Robot Navigation System* \n
1. Proposed a coordinated guiding vector field to guide robots to form an ordering-free platooning formation while moving along the desired paths. Potential applications of arbitrary-dimension desired paths including self-intersected, non-convex, closed and non-closed one. \n

- *Multi-USV Convoying Control* \n
1. Proposed methods concerning target convoying in presence of different situations: rigid and flexible patterns, bearing-only measuring, varying topologies and collision avoidance. 

- *Navigation and Landing for UAV-USV System* \n
1. Proposed a visual navigation and landing control paradigm or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to land on a moving autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). Conducted landing experiments with our HUSTER-30 ASV and the M-100 UAV. \n
